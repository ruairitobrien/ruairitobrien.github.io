      <p><em>I started having very vivid dreams at one point. I decided to start writing them down as soon as I woke up before they slipped away. This one was from August 6th, 2017 in Stockholm.</em></p>
<p>Very heavy night of dreams this night. Most of them forgotten. </p>
<p>There was one where I was with a group of friends from many years ago. Can&#39;t remember what was happening, only the feeling of what it was like to be around them all again.</p>
<p>One dream was about me apparently doing something bad. I appeared to have a large stash of weapons and cash and something was coming to a head. I had a strong impending sense of doom. I recall bragging about all the ill gotten stuff I had. All my stuff was held in fairly silly hidden compartments in a large room. The compartments could be opened by doing things such as moving a book in a bookshelf or stepping on a particular tile. Despite the bragging, I felt very concerned about something but I couldn&#39;t figure out what.  </p>
<p>Then there were two, black widow like, poisonous spiders and it appears they were somehow my children.</p>
<p>Unsure why or with who but there was a large battle. People were fighting and dying everywhere. I was involved. I got wounded.</p>
<p>When the battle ended I was surrounded by people I knew. I was in pain and dying from my wounds. My spider children came to me. I had seen them bite and kill others. I asked them to bite me. Apparently what would be a painless death to end my suffering. I had an almost overwhelming sense of love and affection for them as they bit me. Then I woke up.</p>
