      <p><strong>TL;DR</strong> If you want to try my solution to developing with <a href="http://phaser.io/">phaser 2</a> and es6, try this yeoman generator <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-fire-phaser">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what-">What?</h3>
<p>A while back I discovered a HTML5 game development framework called <a href="http://phaser.io/">phaser</a>. It is really cool and a lot of fun to work with. This post is about how I set up a good and simple development environment to work with Phaser 2 and es6. If you&#39;re interested in getting started with phaser or have just been looking for a good way to use it with es6 then you might find some of the details below useful.</p>
<p>If by some amazing coincidence you happen to be struggling with getting a JavaScript library that relies on globals to work with some es6 build process, this post may also be of use to you.</p>
<h3 id="why-">Why?</h3>
<p>When I first became a programmer all I wanted to do was make games. In my opinion games are the most fun thing to code. They are also a huge amount of work which is probably why I have yet to fully complete one beyond some basic efforts.</p>
<p>I have half built games with XNA, C++, even.... Java. Phaser is the best thing I have come across yet. Despite my love of coding games I just can&#39;t put in all the effort required to make a fancy 3D thing so I love the quick and simple 2D games I can make with phaser. I even had my 7 year old son coding a little on a game and he loves seeing changes like making a character run faster or jump higher. If you want to get started making simple games I can&#39;t recommend phaser enough.</p>
<p>Anyway, since this is JavaScript I immediately hit a problem starting new game projects beyond a simple tutorial and this blog post is about how I got a workflow going that I like and that I wanted to share.</p>
<p>Besides using phaser I did not want to complicate things by adding any other frameworks and I did not want a complicated build process. I just want to make a game and keep things as simple and fun as possible. I really want to use full blown es6 with modules though and that presented a small challenge. Phaser 2 has been around for some time and was not designed to work with es6. Soon phaser 3 will come out and this post will be obsolete but until then, here&#39;s how I got a a nice setup for phaser 2 and es6.</p>
<h3 id="how-">How?</h3>
<p>The first thing I tried to do was use <a href="https://babeljs.io/">babel</a> and <a href="http://browserify.org/">browserify</a> on the command line. I have used npm to install phaser and I had a simple JavaScript file that has an <code>import Phaser from &#39;phaser&#39;</code> statement at the top. It didn&#39;t start well. I was getting an error saying PIXI was not defined. After digging around the phaser source for a while I realized that the built phaser file assigned some dependencies on the global scope. I noticed that the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/phaser">phaser node module</a> had those dependencies separated into their own files too. It occurred to me that I would probably need to use webpack now.</p>
<p>I always end up having to use webpack these days. Even though it&#39;s a great tool, I always try not to use it because it just seems to add a bunch of complexity. Doesn&#39;t seem to be any good way around it here though and I think the config I use is simple enough to be OK.</p>
<p>I had come across the webpack <a href="https://github.com/webpack/expose-loader">expose-loader</a> module before and it appears to solve the particular issue of using a library that relies on globals. I did pause to wonder if it was worth the effort now just so I would use <code>import Phase from &#39;phaser&#39;</code> instead of <code>Phaser</code> as a global and decided it was.</p>
<p>The module loaders are configured like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> pixiiJs = <span class="hljs-string">'pixi.js'</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> p2Js = <span class="hljs-string">'p2.js'</span>;

<span class="hljs-built_in">module</span>: {
    <span class="hljs-attr">loaders</span>: [
      { <span class="hljs-attr">test</span>: <span class="hljs-regexp">/\.css$/</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">loader</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'style-loader!css-loader'</span> },
      { <span class="hljs-attr">test</span>: <span class="hljs-regexp">/\.js$/</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">exclude</span>: <span class="hljs-regexp">/node_modules/</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">loader</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"babel-loader"</span> },
      { <span class="hljs-attr">test</span>: <span class="hljs-regexp">/\.json$/</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">loader</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'json'</span> },      
      { <span class="hljs-attr">test</span>: <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">RegExp</span>(pixiiJs), <span class="hljs-attr">loader</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'expose?PIXI'</span> },
      { <span class="hljs-attr">test</span>: <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">RegExp</span>(p2Js), <span class="hljs-attr">loader</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'expose?p2'</span> }
    ]
  }
</code></pre>
<p><code>{ test: /\.css$/, loader: &#39;style-loader!css-loader&#39; }</code> Allows importing of css files in scripts at build time using <a href="https://github.com/webpack/css-loader">css-loader</a>. Totally optional. I just like that way of getting css in to the page.</p>
<p><code>{ test: /\.js$/, exclude: /node_modules/, loader: &quot;babel-loader&quot; }</code> This converts our es6 code to es5 for browser support.</p>
<p><code>{ test: /\.json$/, loader: &#39;json&#39; }</code> For importing JSON files to scripts at build time.</p>
<p><code>{ test: new RegExp(pixiiJs), loader: &#39;expose?PIXI&#39; }</code> This will assign PIXI to the global object when it gets imported in our es6 code. We do need to have <code>import &#39;pixi&#39;</code> in the entry point of our code. We do not need to use the global object in our code but it is there for phaser to use.</p>
<p><code>{ test: new RegExp(p2Js), loader: &#39;expose?p2&#39; }</code> Same as with PIXI, we are putting this on the global object for phaser to use. We also need <code>import &#39;p2&#39;</code> in the entry point of our code.</p>
<p>That was pretty much the only tricky part.</p>
<p>I am going to be working on a few games in parallel and will probably never finish any of them, so to help with that I created a yeoman generator that will generate a project with a webpack configuration and some sample phaser code written in es6.</p>
<p>If you would like to use it or just want to see what I needed to do to get it all set up run this command (assuming you have nodejs installed)</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs stylus"> npm <span class="hljs-selector-tag">i</span> -g yo generator-fire-phaser
</code></pre><p> Or for yarn (assuming you also installed yeoman globally with yarn)</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs dockerfile"> yarn global <span class="hljs-keyword">add</span><span class="bash"> generator-fire-phaser
</span></code></pre><p> Then in an empty directory run:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs ebnf"><span class="hljs-attribute"> yo fire-phaser</span>
</code></pre><p>You&#39;ll be prompted to answer a few questions that will be used to name the project and set some text in it.</p>
<p> The reference code in there might be handy for seeing how to structure ES6 code with phaser too.</p>
<p>The Github repo for the generator is <a href="https://github.com/ruairitobrien/generator-fire-phaser">here</a>.</p>
<p>Hope you make some games!</p>
